# Dermadive Capstone Project for MAD2502


## Goal

The primary goal of the project is to develop a skincare recommendation system, offering personalized product suggestions based on individual preferences and needs. The system aims to streamline the decision-making process for users by providing relevant recommendations from a database, for the user to make informed decisions.



## Motivation

The motivation behind this project comes from the observance of the overwhelming market of skincare products. With this masy options, consumers have difficulty selecting products that align with their preferences. The existing skincare industry lacks a personalized and unbiased approach. By creating this program, we aim to empower users to make informed choices, ultimately contributing to a more positive skincare experience, with less wastage. 

## Details

### Inputs and outputs

- Input: User's age, primary skin type, and primary skin concern and the type of product they wanted a recommendation for.
- Output: Top 3 recommendations, according to category of how many requirements are matched, and a graphs for comparison.

### Methods


### Results

The  project has designed a program to offer personalized skincare recommendations to users based on their individual preferences, fulfilling its intended purpose. The program efficiently categorizes suggestions into three distinct groups, accommodating various combinations of user preferences. The program also calculates and displays the price per ounce of each product that’s selected to  display these results in a bar graph. This bar graph then appears in the final pop-up window of the quiz, so users can immediately compare skin products as they assess their options.

# Dermadive Capstone Project for MAD2502


## Goal

The primary goal of the project is to develop a skincare recommendation system, offering personalized product suggestions based on individual preferences and needs. The system aims to streamline the decision-making process for users by providing relevant recommendations from a database, for the user to make informed decisions.



## Motivation

The motivation behind this project comes from the observance of the overwhelming market of skincare products. With this masy options, consumers have difficulty selecting products that align with their preferences. The existing skincare industry lacks a personalized and unbiased approach. By creating this program, we aim to empower users to make informed choices, ultimately contributing to a more positive skincare experience, with less wastage. 

## Details
